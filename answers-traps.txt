Q: Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
A: The parameters are stored into a0, a1 and a2. In the example, 13 is stored into a2.

Q: Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
A: Function main() doesn't explicitly call f, but implicitly calculates the value which is 12. f() call g() at 14, where x is stored at a0, and then call the inline g().

Q: At what address is the function printf located? 
A: At 30(base16) + 1554(base10), which is 642(base16).

Q: What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
A: rd is not specified in this case. And before jumping to printf, the ra is set to 30(base16).

Q: Run the following code.
	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
A: The output is "He110 World". If RISC-V is big-endian, i should be set to 0x726c6400. It's OK for the 57616 to remain the same.

Q: In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
A: x will be always equal to 3. But y will be arbitrary value, because printing y uses the third argument, e.g. a2. Since it is not specified, it will be arbitrary value.
